👋 Hi, I’m Edgaras. I'm looking for a job as a Web developer. My goal is simple: learn to be a great coder and have fun along the way.

Why? Because Code + Ideas = Reality.

I'm a Web development enthusiast creating full scope projects that include Front-end, Back-end, databases and design. I absolutely love building products that make my ideas come true.

I was previously working as a telecommunication engineer so I have a deep understanding in networking, have knowledge about FTTH, GPON, etc. technologies.

I'm seeking an entry-level role as a full-stack or front-end developer. Let’s talk 😉
